# C Sharp MVC Directory and File Template

#### A quicker start for C Sharp projects

#### By Scott Bergler

## Description
This template will create the directories and basic files needed to start a web project in C Sharp. I adapted it from Sayed I. Hashimi's [article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/04/02/how-to-create-your-own-templates-for-dotnet-new/). The directory structure and file contents are from Epicodus C Sharp curriculum and may not be suited for all projects.

The project files generated will have starter content as outlined in the Epicodus C Sharp course. The template will give relevant namespaces and paths for your project (i.e. TemplateMVC will be replaced everywhere with the name you give to your project - YourProjectName).

The directory/file structure created is:

```
YourProjectName.Solution
├── YourProjectName
│   ├── Controllers
│   │   ├── HomeController.cs
│   │   └── YourClassController.cs
│   │
│   ├── Models
│   │   └── YourClass.cs
│   │
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
│   ├── YourProjectName.csproj
│   │
│   └── Views
│   │   ├── YourClass
│   │   │   ├── DeleteAll.cshtml
│   │   │   ├── Index.cshtml
│   │   │   ├── New.cshtml
│   │   │   └── Show.cshtml
│   │   ├── Home
│   │   │   └── Index.cshtml
│   │   └── Shared
│   │        └── _Layout.cshtml
│   │
│   └── wwwroot
│       ├── css
│       │   ├── bootstrap.min.css
│       │   └── styles.css
│       ├── js
│       │   └── scripts.js
│       └── Shared
│           ├── bootstrap.min.js
│           └── _Layout.cshtml
│
└── YourProjectName.Tests
    ├── ControllerTests
    │   ├── HomeControllerTests.cs
    │   └── YourClassControllerTests.cs
    │
    ├── ModelTests
    │   └── YourClassClassTests.cs
    │
    └── YourProjectName.Tests.csproj

```

There is a lot more a person could do with this, but I'm keeping this simple for now, trying to stay within the scope of the type of projects we're currently doing at Epicodus. I will be adding to it as the course continues.

### Specifications:
##### Spec 1: Do a thing:
- [ ] **Expect:**  
Input: some input;  
Output: some output;

## Setup/Installation Requirements
Clone the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/skillitzimberg/TemplateMVC.Solution).

While following this set up guide, replace both the brackets - [] - and the content between them with the information relevant to your situation. This is just an example guide.

Install the template using the command line interface (cli)/terminal:
* dotnet new --install [ /Users/Your/Path/Here ]/TemplateMVC.Solution

For example: When cloned to the Epicodus computer Desktop, the path would be /Users/Guest/Desktop/TemplateMVC.Solution.
The above command would then be:
* dotnet new --install /Users/Guest/Desktop/TemplateMVC.Solution

Navigate to the directory that you want your project to be in (i.e. Desktop, Documents, or wherever you keep your projects).

Run the this command in the cli/terminal:
* dotnet new templatemvc -n [ YourProjectName ] -o [ YourProjectName ].Solution

For example: If your project is called Banana the command would be:
* dotnet new templatemvc -n Banana -o Banana.Solution

Remove .git directory: run this command in YourProjectName.Solution directory.
* rm -rf .git

Be sure to git init again for a fresh start!

Open the directory in your text editor. Open the .template.config/template.json file and change the author name to your own. Read the article mentioned above for details on this file and how this template was created.
